# Zombie Session Files - Problem Solved

## Problem Summary
The system was spawning thousands of zombie session files every few seconds, causing lockups and performance issues.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Bulletproof Session Logger (`services/diary-api/bulletproof_session_logger.py`)
- **Issue**: Created persistent session files in 3 locations simultaneously
- **Paths**: `/tmp/fk2_session_backup.json`, `logs/current_session.json`, `.claude/session_backup.json`
- **Problem**: Exponential backoff retry loops that never terminated
- **Fix**: Disabled automatic execution and persistence paths

### 2. MCP Knowledge Server (`services/mcp-knowledge-server/src/knowledge_server.py`)
- **Issue**: Infinite `while True` loop monitoring parent process every 30 seconds
- **Problem**: Each loop iteration created new activity logger sessions
- **Fix**: Disabled the infinite monitoring loop (lines 1202-1233)

### 3. Activity Logger (`services/mcp-knowledge-server/src/activity_logger.py`)
- **Issue**: Automatic session creation on every server startup
- **Problem**: Created webhook-based sessions that never cleaned up properly
- **Fix**: Disabled automatic session initialization

### 4. Session Cascade Effect
- **Issue**: Cleanup scripts triggered more session creation
- **Problem**: "Bulletproof" recovery systems kept recreating deleted files
- **Result**: Infinite loop of session creation → cleanup → recreation

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `services/diary-api/bulletproof_session_logger.py`
   - Disabled automatic execution
   - Commented out all persistence paths
   
2. `services/mcp-knowledge-server/src/knowledge_server.py`
   - Disabled infinite parent process monitoring loop
   
3. `services/mcp-knowledge-server/src/activity_logger.py`
   - Disabled automatic session creation

### New Files:
- `scripts/kill-zombie-sessions.sh` - Emergency cleanup script

## Prevention Measures

1. **Session logging is now disabled** until a proper fix can be implemented
2. **Monitoring loops are disabled** to prevent infinite process spawning
3. **Cleanup script available** to kill any future zombie processes
4. **Persistence paths removed** to prevent file accumulation

## To Re-enable Session Logging (Future)

When fixing the session system:

1. **Add proper session termination** - ensure all sessions have definitive end points
2. **Implement single session manager** - avoid multiple redundant logging systems
3. **Add session timeout** - automatically expire old sessions
4. **Remove infinite loops** - use event-driven architecture instead
5. **Test cleanup thoroughly** - ensure cleanup doesn't trigger more creation

## Testing Results

✅ No more zombie session files being created  
✅ No infinite loops running  
✅ MCP server processes properly terminated  
✅ System performance restored  

## Command to Check Status
```bash
# Check for zombie processes
ps aux | grep -E "(mcp|bulletproof|knowledge)" | grep -v grep

# Check for session files
find . -name "*session*" -type f | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .venv

# Run cleanup if needed
./scripts/kill-zombie-sessions.sh
```
